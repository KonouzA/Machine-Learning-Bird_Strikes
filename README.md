# Bird Strikes in Aviation: Aircraft Collision Modeling

This project analyzes real-world bird strike incidents reported in U.S. aviation between 2000 and 2011. Using data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the notebook presents a complete machine learning workflow to model, predict, and gain insights into aircraft collision risks caused by birds on an imbalanced dataset.
